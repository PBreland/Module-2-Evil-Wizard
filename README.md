This is my Module 2 Evil Wizard project. For starters, I created the class Character and within that I defined the methods attack, display stats, heal and special ability. Once that was complete, I created subclasses from the class Character and assigned attributes to each subclass like name, health, attack power and defined each special ability with a unique skill. Once that was complete, I defined the Main Menu where you can begin your journey against the mean Evi Wizard. Start by selecting which clas you want to be and then you pick a name for your character. Then you select an action whether it's using your basic attack, special attack, heal or view stats. As you input an action, there is a counter action by the evil wizard until one of you are defeated and are prompted with a message at the end with the result! Enjoy!
